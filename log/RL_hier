Warning: Your Stan program has a parameter sensitivity_hier with a lower and
    upper bound in its declaration. These hard constraints are not
    recommended, for two reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or
    physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a
    parameter will fall inside a specified range, and (b) The infinite
    gradient induced by a hard constraint can cause difficulties for Stan's
    sampling algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend soft constraints
    rather than hard constraints; for example, instead of constraining an
    elasticity parameter to fall between 0, and 1, leave it unconstrained and
    give it a normal(0.5,0.5) prior distribution.
