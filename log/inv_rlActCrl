  Gradient evaluation took 0.000713 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 7.13 seconds.
  Adjust your expectations accordingly!
  Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
  Exception: gamma_lpdf: Random variable is 0, but must be positive finite! (in '/tmp/httpstan_xjx834xa/model_irbr7ohr.stan', line 101, column 6 to column 37)
  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
