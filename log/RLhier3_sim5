    is a gamma or inverse-gamma distribution with parameters that are equal
    to each other and set to values less than 1. This is mathematically
    acceptable and can make sense in some problems, but typically we see this
    model used as an attempt to assign a noninformative prior distribution.
    In fact, priors such as inverse-gamma(.001,.001) can be very strong, as
    explained by Gelman (2006). Instead we recommend something like a
    normal(0,1) or student_t(4,0,1), with parameter constrained to be
    positive.
