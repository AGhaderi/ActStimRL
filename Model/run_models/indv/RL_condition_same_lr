  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
  Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:

  Gradient evaluation took 0.000124 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 1.24 seconds.
  Adjust your expectations accordingly!
