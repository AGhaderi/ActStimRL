  Gradient evaluation took 0.001488 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 14.88 seconds.

  Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
  Exception: bernoulli_lpmf: Probability parameter is -nan, but must be in the interval [0, 1] (in '/tmp/httpstan__ijkisml/model_dyd6dsi7.stan', line 130, column 8 to column 46)
  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

  Exception: gamma_lpdf: Random variable is 0, but must be positive finite! (in '/tmp/httpstan__ijkisml/model_dyd6dsi7.stan', line 109, column 4 to column 34)
  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
  Gradient evaluation took 0.001465 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 14.65 seconds.
