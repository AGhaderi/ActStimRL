  Exception: gamma_lpdf: Random variable is 0, but must be positive finite! (in '/tmp/httpstan_un0d1et4/model_zuftt2rh.stan', line 105, column 4 to column 34)
  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

  Gradient evaluation took 0.002124 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 21.24 seconds.

  If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
  but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

  Gradient evaluation took 0.002019 seconds
  1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 20.19 seconds.
